# linmath.h -- A small library for linear math as required for computer graphics

linmath.h provides the most used types required programming computer graphice:

vec2 -- 2 element vector of floats
vec3 -- 3 element vector of floats
vec4 -- 4 element vector of floats (4th component used for homogenous computations)

vec2f -- 2 element vector of floats
vec3f -- 3 element vector of floats
vec4f -- 4 element vector of floats (4th component used for homogenous computations)

vec2d -- 2 element vector of doubles
vec3d -- 3 element vector of doubles
vec4d -- 4 element vector of doubles (4th component used for homogenous computations)

mat4x4 -- 4 by 4 elements matrix, computations are done in column major order
quat -- quaternion

The types are deliberately named like the types in GLSL. In fact they are meant to
be used for the client side computations and passing to same typed GLSL uniforms.
